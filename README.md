# Social-Dynamics-Analysis

There is a theory in social science, that people adopt similar patterns of language use when they interact. This project will investigate whether this concept is present in an online forum, where participants communicate with each other via conversations online. I will investigate whether members who are communicating directly with each other (via
threads) use similar language, which may be different to other members of the forum. I will also investigate whether the language used changes over time. For example, is the proportion of language expressing optimism different between groups, and/or does it change over time?
